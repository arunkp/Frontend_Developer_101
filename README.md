2. Install [Visual Studio Code (VsCode)](https://code.visualstudio.com/):  and Once you are sure VsCode is installed, Install these extensions on VsCode:
   - [Prettier](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=esbenp.prettier-vscode)
   - [LiveServer](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ritwickdey.LiveServer)
3. Install [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) on your machine

   - Make sure not set any PASSPHRASE, just hit "Enter" key when prompted
5. Create a [Github](https://github.com/) Account
6. Add the SSH Key you recently generate in Step 4(above) to Github.com: [Guide](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account)
